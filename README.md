This repository showcases my Java programming practice as a B.Tech 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student. 
It includes core OOP concepts, data structure implementations, and mini console projects built during my coursework.
I’m currently strengthening my fundamentals in Java, DSA, and object-oriented design, with future goals in cybersecurity and cryptography.
Each program here reflects consistent learning, problem-solving, and structured coding habits.
I’m building this repo as a solid foundation for upcoming academic projects and real-world software development.
